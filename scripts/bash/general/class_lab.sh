Part I: The Challenges
Processes & Daemons
1. List a specific process: command to list all running processes associated with the
daemon nginx.
2. Kill by name: How do you kill all processes named my_script.sh without looking up
their PIDs manually?
3. Background execution: How do you run backup.sh in the background so it
continues running even if you close the terminal (logout)?
4. Find PID: Write a command to extract only the Process ID (PID) of the sshd
daemon.
5. Process Hierarchy: How do you view processes in a tree format to see which
parent process spawned which child daemon?
6. Open Files: How do you list all files currently opened by a process with PID 1234?
7. Check Daemon Status: Using systemd, how do you check if the docker daemon is
currently active?
8. Priority: How do you start a command heavy_calc.sh with the lowest possible CPU
priority (niceness)?
Files, Copying & Archiving
9. Recursive Copy: Command to copy the folder /var/www/html to /backup/html
recursively.
10. Preserve Attributes: How do you copy a file secret.key to /tmp while strictly
preserving its original timestamps, ownership, and permissions?
11. Sync Directories: Use rsync to copy files from src/ to dest/, but only copy files that
are newer in the source or missing in the destination.
12. Update Copy: Use cp to copy files from dir1 to dir2, but only if the source file is
newer than the destination file.
13. Remote Copy: How do you Copy a local file app.conf to /etc/ on a remote server
192.168.1.50 using SSH/SCP?
14. Archive & Compress: Create a .tar.gz archive of the /var/log directory.
The find Command
15. Size Search: Find all files in /home that are larger than 500MB.
16. Time Search: Find all files in /var/log that were modified in the last 7 days.
17. User Search: Find all files in /tmp owned by the user jenkins.
18. Find & Delete: Find all empty directories inside /data and delete them
automatically.
19. Permission Search: Find all files in the current directory that have full 777
permissions.
20. Find & Copy: Find all files ending in .jpg in the current folder and copy them to
/images/.
Regular Expressions (Grep, Sed, Awk)
21. Email Extraction: Extract all valid email addresses from a text file contacts.txt
using grep.
22. Case Insensitive Search: Search for the string "error" in syslog regardless of
capitalization (e.g., finds "Error", "ERROR", "error").
23. Line Start Anchor: Find all lines in config.ini that strictly start with the word root.
24. Invert Match: Display all lines in access.log that do not contain the IP 192.168.1.1.
25. Recursive Grep: Search for the string "TODO" inside every text file in the current
directory and all subdirectories.
26. Sed Replace: Replace every occurrence of the word "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" in
the file hosts.txt and save the changes in place.
27. Comment Removal: Use sed or grep to view a configuration file without seeing
lines that start with #.
28. IP Validation: Use a regex to find lines that look like a standard IPv4 address
(digit.digit.digit.digit format) in a file.
Complex Combinations
29. Process & Regex: List all running processes, but filter the output to show only
those running as root using grep.
30. Find, Regex & Execute: Find all files named *.log, search inside them for the word
"Critical", and print the filename if a match is found.
